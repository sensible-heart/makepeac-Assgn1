read CITATION
This project uses code from a couple of tutorials. 
Those tutorials were found at the following links:
http://windrealm.org/tutorials/android/listview-with-checkboxes-without-listactivity.php on 09/17/14
http://www.mikeplate.com/2010/01/21/show-a-context-menu-for-long-clicks-in-an-android-listview/ on 09/23/14
And some code was adapted from the Labs, namely Lab 2 09/16/14 and Lab 3 09/23/14.
Any code that has been taken will have a comment before it and after it to identify it as not from me.
